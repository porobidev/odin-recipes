# Project: Recipes

This is the first project assignment from **TheOdinProject**'s curriculum and it reflects everything I learned from **HTML Foundations**:

* What are elements and tags and how to use them
* Creating the boilerplate/structure of a HTML webpage
* Styling text: headings, paragraphs, bold, italic
* Creating and adding items to ordered and unordered lists
* Adding links and images
