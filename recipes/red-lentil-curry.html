        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <li>Wash lentils in cold water until water runs clear.</li>
            <li>Put lentils in a pot with enough water to cover; bring to a boil
                and reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer, adding water as
                needed to keep lentils covered, until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and
                stir onions in hot oil until caramelized, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix together curry paste, curry powder, turmeric, cumin, chili powder,
                salt, sugar, garlic, and ginger in a large bowl; stir into onions. Increase
                heat to high and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in tomato puree and lentils; cook until warmed through.</li>
        </ol>
