        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ cups whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix flour and salt together in a bowl. Stir in water to form a soft dough.</li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead several times.
                Divide into 8 pieces and roll each into a ball. Roll each ball into a very
                thin round using a rolling pin. </li>
            <li>Heat a griddle over medium-high heat. Cook each dough round on griddle until
                dough bubbles and blisters appear, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until lightly
                browned on the other side. </li>
        </ol>
